# Actor Database App

# Overview

A robust application which allows for actors to keep track of both their finances as well as their auditions all in one place. The ability to consolidate income and expenses into an annual report to ease with taxes. The ability to enter and search auditions and bookings to keep track of the progress of your career. The ability to sync with a calendar so you know where you need to be and what you have coming up at all times. A database of casting and production folk whom you've come into contact with so you can maximize your connections and stay on top of key industry players.

# Home Page
![Home Page](assets/home.png)

Things that I think we can lose from the homepage are the following tabs in the main body:

***Calendar*** - I think this is an outdated feature and most folks want their applications to sync with whatever calendar application they already use.

***Stats*** - While this may be helpful to have at some point so actors can see their audition to booking ratios I think it would be better served to eliminate for the time being and if re-introduced, make it in the format of a bar graph or something. Something akin to watching a stock's price index over the course of a day, month, year... That way you can track trends of number of auditions this month versus last or even what march's audition numbers looked like for this year versus last year, etc.

We can also lose the middle sections of ***Quickstart guide***, ***FAQ's*** and ***Tech Support***. Those can be drop down menu items from the main nav bar under ***Support*** or some such.

We can also lose the following from the navbar:

***Logs*** - This is essentially convered by the tabs in the main body of the home page.

***Community*** - This area while something you had gotten excited about (Twitter, etc) requires more person power and upkeep than I am willing to commit to at the moment. Looking for a very barebones app to start that doesn't get muddled in trying to do too many things at once and get spread thin.

***Toolbox*** - This area basically sends you off to some other webpages with tips on walking the redcarpet, copies of agreement mock-ups and standard contracts for dealing with non-union productions and procuring a copy and credit for your services as an actor. Again, I want barebones.

The ***Help*** section can be the support area and house the FAQ's and Quickstart/Walkthrough kind of stuff.

# Auditions

![Audition/Interview Page](assets/audition.png)

Currently you have the option of creating a new audition or editing a previously logged audition to change info or to update it to a callback (the next phase of the audition process when you have moved forward from the first round.)

I don't like the fact that in this version it auto-numbers your auditions, lists them in order of most recent to less recent, and doesn't give you the option to search for a specific audition. I think there should be more manipulation options (like you would have in any database) and ability to view things according to many different criteria.

I want streamlined quicker access to the info a user wants.

![New Audition](assets/newAudition.png)

Here we can see a lot of drop down menus for entering a new audition. There are a lot of outdated types of dropdown selections for different parts of this page that applied to a time when auditions were done more in person or when people sent physical headshots out and follow-up postacrds, etc. So again I want to streamline this area a bit to make it more easy to use and flow with.

Also as a general note, I would like the ability for the user to generate their own dropdown menu titles or clarifications so they can tailor it more specifically to them. This way if they have a different type of expense category they can enter it and make the app more personal for themselves.

On this page I would like to have the following sections and options:

First an area to get the basic audition information:

#### Title of the Audition
What Round it is (1st audition, call back, screen test, etc.)
