# Actor Database App

# Overview

A robust application which allows for actors to keep track of both their finances as well as their auditions all in one place. The ability to consolidate income and expenses into an annual report to ease with taxes. The ability to enter and search auditions and bookings to keep track of the progress of your career. The ability to sync with a calendar so you know where you need to be and what you have coming up at all times. A database of casting and production folk whom you've come into contact with so you can maximize your connections and stay on top of key industry players.

# Home Page
![Home Page](assets/home.png)

Things that I think we can lose from the homepage are the following tabs in the main body:

***Calendar*** - I think this is an outdated feature and most folks want their applications to sync with whatever calendar application they already use.

***Stats*** - While this may be helpful to have at some point so actors can see their audition to booking ratios I think it wopuld be better served to eliminate for the time being and if reintroduced, make it in the format of a bar graph or something. Something akin to watching a stock's price index over the course of a day, month, year... That way you can track trends of number of auditions this month versus last or even what march's audition numbers looked like for this year versus last year, etc.

We can also lose the middle sections of ***Quickstart guide***, ***FAQ's*** and ***Tech Support***. Thos can be drop down menu items from the main nav bar under "support" or some such.

We can also lose the following from the navbar:

***Logs*** - This is essentially convered by the tabs in the main body of the home page

***Community*** - This area while something you had gotten excited about (Twitter, etc) requires more person power and upkeep than I am willing to commit to at the moment. Looking for a very barebones app to start that doesn't get muddled in trying to do too many things at once and get spread thin.

***Toolbox*** - This area basically sends you off to some other webpages with tips on walking the redcarpet, copies of agreement mock-ups and standard contracts for dealing with non-union productions and procuring a copy and credit for your services as ana actor. Again, I want barebones.

The ***Help*** section can be the support area and house the faq's and quickstart walkthrough kind of stuff.
